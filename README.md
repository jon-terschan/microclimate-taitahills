# Overview
This repository is supplementary material for the Master's thesis "Assessing the Impact of TLS-Derived Vegetation Structure on Microclimatic Variability in Taita Hills, Kenya" by Jonathan Terschanski.

It contains the author's code to:
* extract structural metrics from pre-processed point cloud data (mostly adapted from supervisors),
* process microclimate and macroclimate data,
* generate figures used in the thesis,

and a licensing agreement.

Code is commented and semi-reproducible. File dependencies are not provided due to file size limitations and time constraints.
